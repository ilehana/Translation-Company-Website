        <dd>Adapting a product's translation to a specific country or region. It is the second phase of a larger process of product translation and cultural adaptation (for specific countries, regions, cultures or groups) to account for differences in distinct markets, a process known as internationalisation and localisation.</dd><br><br>

        <dd>Communication of the meaning of a source-language text by means of an equivalent target-language text.[1] The English language draws a terminological distinction (which does not exist in every language) between translating (a written text) and interpreting (oral or signed communication between users of different languages); under this distinction, translation can begin only after the appearance of writing within a language community.</dd><br><br>

        <dd>Translational activity in which one produces a first and final target-language output on the basis of a one-time exposure to an expression in a source language.</dd><br><br>

        <dd>Preparation of video game software and hardware for sale in a new region or country. Translating the game's text is a large part of localization, however this is not the entire process. Video game localization includes any changes made to a game, including altering art assets, creating new packaging and manuals, recording new audio, transforming hardware, cutting out whole portions of the game due to differing cultural sensitivities and/or local legal requirements, and even adding sections to replace cut content.</dd><br><br>
